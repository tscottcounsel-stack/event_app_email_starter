\## 30-Day Go-To-Market Plan for Event Organizer–Vendor Platform

\## 30-Day Go-To-Market Plan for Event Organizer–Vendor Platform



\### \*\*Goal\*\*



Seed the marketplace by onboarding vendors first, then attract organizers once vendor listings show activity and credibility.



---



\### \*\*Week 1: Foundation \& Vendor Funnel\*\*



\*\*Objectives:\*\* Create credibility, start recruiting vendors manually.



\*\*Actions:\*\*



1\. \*\*Create a vendor signup landing page\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Collect name, email, service category, Instagram link, and city.

&nbsp;  \* Headline: \*"Get early access – free exposure for your event business!"\*

2\. \*\*Prepare vendor outreach templates\*\* (email + DM):



&nbsp;  \* \*\*Message Example:\*\*



&nbsp;    > Hi \[Name]! We’re building a new Atlanta-based platform that connects vendors (like \[category]) directly with event organizers. It’s free during launch, and we’re featuring early vendors on our homepage. Would you like to be listed?

3\. \*\*Build your seed database\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Pull 100+ local vendor leads from Instagram, Yelp, and Facebook groups (weddings, food trucks, DJs, photographers).

&nbsp;  \* Prioritize categories that attract frequent bookings: catering, DJs, decorators, photo booths, venues.

4\. \*\*Manually onboard 10–20 vendors\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Create their profiles in the app yourself (photos, descriptions, pricing) with consent.



---



\### \*\*Week 2: Marketplace Presence\*\*



\*\*Objectives:\*\* Make the platform look alive, even without real events.



\*\*Actions:\*\*



1\. \*\*Add sample/demo events\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Example: \*"Spring Wedding Expo 2025"\*, \*"Corporate Vendor Showcase"\*, etc.

&nbsp;  \* Let vendors “apply” to simulate flow.

2\. \*\*Feature vendor listings on social media\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Post vendor spotlights on Instagram and LinkedIn.

&nbsp;  \* Tag vendors; they’ll often reshare.

3\. \*\*Create a simple press/launch announcement\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Example caption: \*"Atlanta’s first platform connecting event vendors and organizers directly. Join free while we’re in beta!"\*

4\. \*\*Start building the email list for organizers\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Add a form on the landing page: \*"Organizers: Get early access when we launch event bookings!"\*



---



\### \*\*Week 3: Organizer Outreach\*\*



\*\*Objectives:\*\* Attract organizers using visible vendor inventory.



\*\*Actions:\*\*



1\. \*\*Reach out to small event planners, venues, and schools\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Offer them a free event listing.

&nbsp;  \* Highlight the preloaded vendor pool.

&nbsp;  \* Example pitch: \*"We already have 30+ local vendors waiting to connect – want to post your next event for free?"\*

2\. \*\*Host a beta launch webinar or networking event\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Let vendors meet potential organizers.

&nbsp;  \* Record testimonials and post them online.

3\. \*\*Launch a referral program\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Vendors who invite an organizer (and vice versa) earn featured placement or free months.



---



\### \*\*Week 4: Feedback, Optimization, and Proof\*\*



\*\*Objectives:\*\* Turn early engagement into validation material.



\*\*Actions:\*\*



1\. \*\*Collect feedback from both sides\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Short survey: What worked, what’s missing, what they’d pay for.

2\. \*\*Highlight success stories\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Post: \*"Vendors from our beta got 3 booking leads in their first week!"\*

3\. \*\*Refine onboarding flow\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Simplify vendor registration and event posting.

4\. \*\*Prepare for scaling\*\*



&nbsp;  \* Set up paid plans or premium placement options.



---



\### \*\*Metrics to Track\*\*



\* Vendors onboarded: 50+

\* Organizer signups: 10+

\* Event listings created: 5–10 (real or demo)

\* Engagement: vendor profiles viewed, applications submitted

\* Social followers/email subscribers: 200+



---



\### \*\*Next Step After Month 1\*\*



Once you have ~50 vendors and ~10 organizers with a few events running:



\* Turn on basic analytics in the app.

\* Launch automated onboarding emails.

\* Prepare your pitch for local partnerships (venues, event planners, schools, corporate offices).
